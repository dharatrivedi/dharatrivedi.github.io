      Our research efforts aim to understand, tailor, and manipulate the atomistic level description of a system with the development and implementation of quantum-classical dynamics. It explores the details of underlying processes that influence this system, providing a better insight into the cutting edge experimental research and have high potential to impact the society by enabling new technologies or by improving the existing ones. The research in our group revolves around the following main themes:

      The solar energy carries an enormous potential to resolve the current energy and environmental pollution problems. Development of efficient tools for conversion of sunlight to electrical and chemical energy is critical for promoting the renewable energy economy. This challenge has stimulated a large number of experimental and theoretical studies aimed at finding materials capable of either transforming solar energy into electricity or inducing chemical reactions. The unique physical and chemical properties of nanoscale systems make it a great candidate for harvesting solar energy. A real-time theoretical modeling provides understanding of the system in order to harness their unique properties within the context of reducing the environmental impact of energy consumption.
