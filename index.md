# Welcome to Trivedi Research Group!

We are a computational and theoretical physical chemistry group with broad interests in dynamical processes occurring at the nanoscale. Our research focuses developing new methods as applies to problems in nanotechnology, energy and charge transfer in complex condensed-phase chemical and biological environments, and properties of materials. Research in our group is interdisciplinary in nature, typically at the interface between Physics, Chemistry and Nanoscience.
